# CREATE Poster

I would like you to collect all the results you generated from your dataset so far this semester and present them on a paper poster to be hanged on a wall at the CREATE event. This assignment is for creating the first draft of the poster. 


# Technical details of poster

The poster must be in PDF format and sized 48" x 36"  (landscape orientation preferred)**.** You can prepare it with any software (Powerpoint, Inkscape, Adobe Illustrator, etc), but I am also providing you access to an online collaborative document preparation website, [Marq](https://www.marq.com/). Create a new account and once logged in, you can duplicate one of the examples below (or from [this template](https://app.marq.com/invitations/accept/inv_14c78e59-e748-452e-853b-676fc4e08c55)). Or, you can start from scratch by clicking on "New Project" on the top of the page, and then selecting "From template". Type "academic" in the search bar at the very top and you can also mark the "Posters" checkbox. You can select one of these templates or start from scratch using the "Blank" category. Make sure to adjust the page size to the above numbers. You can also use [Canva](https://www.canva.com/), which has good [research poster templates in landscape orientation](https://www.canva.com/templates/?query=research-posters&fFormat=0OI). Submit a viewable share link to your poster below or if you have it in a different format, just post an exported PDF.

# What to put on your poster?

A research poster format is very similar to the abstract you wrote earlier. That abstract should be included in your poster, and you can distribute the text into different sections. A poster should usually have these components:

1. Introduction/Background
2. Question, Problem or Hypothesis
3. Experimental  Approach/Design
4. Data and Results
5. Discussion and Conclusion

For a better presentation, try to excel in each of these categories:

1. Research Originality/Novelty
2. Poster Organization, Style, Visual Appeal
3. Oral presentation of research
4. Ability to Answer Questions
5. Overall Presentation
