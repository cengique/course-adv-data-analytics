# Assignment 7: Web APIs and interactive Javascript graphs (due midnight Wed Oct 9)

# Questions:

1. Based on the Tutorial 1 content we did in class, create your own visualization. Instead of creating a local file, fork my [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/cengique/sj4e0qzL/) page from the top menu, then publish and share your link. You do NOT need to include the `<html>` and `<body>` tags in the HTML window and you can put Javascript directly in the Javascript window as in my example. Include the following elements in your visualization:
    - Circles, rectangles, and text
    - Use transitions to change color, text, and position
    - Optional: Any other elements from the [D3.js 3.x API](https://github.com/d3/d3-3.x-api-reference/blob/master/API-Reference.md)
1. Based on the Tutorial 2 content, load your CSV dataset into Javascript and use D3.js to visualize one or more columns. [Join my Repl.it](https://replit.com/join/obarmjtnfe-cengique). Do NOT fork it. Instead, follow my example in the `gunay/` folder. Create your own folder and upload your datafile in it. Edit the `index.html` in the base folder to add a link to your subfolder like my example. Copy my gunay/index.html file into your folder and edit it. Include the following elements in your visualization:
    - For one column from your dataset, create circles, rectangles, or text elements. 
    - Create a second set of elements from another column, but position them close to the first one, or change one of its attributes with it (for instance, position or color).
2. Finally, we will create interactive visualizations of data retrieved from public  APIs using Javascript libraries as shown in the class lecture. We will  use [ObservableHQ](https://observablehq.com/), where you need to open an account. Start from [my example notebook](https://observablehq.com/@cengique/api-data-example) and **fork it** to modify in your account. We will use the [MusicBrainz search API](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Development/XML_Web_Service/Version_2/Search#Artist) to retrieve music band information that has a keyword (e.g.,  "madonna") in  them and the graph plots the names of the musicians and  their scores as  bars. Your assignment is to change the API call to  query with a  different keyword (or use another API query option) and  display the  results in a graph. Make your fork **public**, and **post the Share link** here.
3. *Optional challenges:* Doing one or both of these will get you **extra credit**:
   1. Use a different API from [this list](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis) or [this list](https://explore.postman.com/) and display the data in one of the ways in above question, or graph it any other way.  You can create a new notebook, or simply save your previous one under a different name. Prefer one that requires no authentication, otherwise you need additional code.
   2. Try Observable visualizations other than bar  charts and with data from non-API sources. Follow [these examples](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/introduction-to-data) to see how you can import data into your notebooks (e.g. your CSV file). Choose among several [D3.js visualization templates](https://observablehq.com/@d3/gallery) to fork and modify. Check out [their tutorials](https://observablehq.com/tutorials) also.
