# Assignment 6: Interactive visualization dashboards on Tableau or PowerBI (due midnight Wed Sep 25) 

Upload your data and share **two graphs/dashboards** from with Tableau/PowerBI. Briefly **explain** what we learn from the graphs. Extra credit for adding **functional filters**. Find Tableau tutorials on D2L under Resources>Tableau. Do ONE of following:

1. Download the [Tableau Desktop](https://www.tableau.com/products/desktop) app ([free for students](https://www.tableau.com/academic/students)), create a workbook, and publish it publicly via the [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/) website. You will need to create an account on Tableau Public. Use the Server > Tableau Public > Save to Tableau Public on the desktop app to export onto the website. If it complains about your data not being "extracted", go to the Data > your dataset > Extract to enable it. Post your public portfolio URL here. See [example 1](https://public.tableau.com/profile/blake.kelley#!/vizhome/SuicideBook1/Sheet1?publish=yes) and [example 2](https://public.tableau.com/profile/kam8654#!/vizhome/SchoolShootingsintheUSOvertheAges/Sheet1).
2. If you want your visualizations to be more private, open an account on [Tableau Online](https://www.tableau.com/products/cloud-bi) and use it instead of the desktop app. It has most of the same features, and you can share with specific people or via a link. I still need you to post the link, but one will have to sign up and log in before being able to see your work.
3. Alternatively, use the [Power BI](https://app.powerbi.com) which we can access via your GGC [Office 365](https://ggcedu-my.sharepoint.com) account. Make sure to share your visualization with everyone and post the share link here.
