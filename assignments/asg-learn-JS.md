# Assignment 7: Learn JavaScript in 4-10 hours (due midnight Wed Oct 2) 

As the title says, your assignment is to learn JavaScript basics in preparation for the material we will cover after the midterm exam.

# Notes:

* Do **ONE** of the following course options.
* For each course, open the code and follow along by **doing the examples and the challenges**.
* Post here **screenshots of the challenges and of the completion certificate** posted on your LinkedIn wall (or simply the certificate itself).
* Note that even though a course is listed at a certain duration (such as 4 hours), but this doesn't include the time you need to test the code yourself and do the challenges. A more accurate duration should be **%50-%100 more of the listed amount** (so 4 hours become 6-8 hours).
* Report **how long** it took to do the course and **how informative** you found it.

# Course Options:

1. [Learning the JavaScript Language](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-the-javascript-language-22309208): Listed at 4 hours, but it is more like 5 hours based on student feedback. This course does not have any prereqs and it is a pretty good for beginners. It does not go into much web development and simply focuses on the language itself. Use Github Codespaces to copy and paste some code examples, but no real challenges - just quizzes.
2. [Hands-On Introduction: JavaScript](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/hands-on-introduction-javascript/): Listed as less than 2 hours, this course is much more compact, but requires prior knowledge on both web development and Javascript. It also dips into modern web development a bit. Use Github Codespaces to follow along.
3. [JavaScript Essential Training course](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/javascript-essential-training/): Listed at 6 hours, this is the longest and most comprehensive tutorial. However, previous students reported that it took almost 10 hours to follow along by doing the examples.
