# Final version of CREATE poster (due midnight Mon Nov 11)

Do the following to get points:

1. Based on the feedback you received to your last week's submission and discussion in class, update your poster by adjusting your main focus, adjusting existing graphs and creating new ones, and changing text to reflect these changes. Use the [techniques you learned in the ITEC 3160 course](https://cengique.github.io/lectures-prog-data-analysis/chapter-data-wrangle-aggregate/#/) and apply to your analysis.
2. Select one of your main results and find a statistical test that you can apply to confirm it from the [scipy.stats package](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/stats.html). Turn your result into a hypothesis that you can test. Find a *p* value and explain if the test is successful and what are the implications. Include this statistical test and its result on the poster even if it fails to show significance. Post the code and details of the test you used here, and summarize it for a lay audience on your poster.
3. Post both a link to your poster file and also a downloaded PDF version of it so I can easily submit for printing.

## Poster printing note

I will print your posters at the [LDI Reproprinting Center at Lawrenceville](https://ldireproprinting.com/find-a-location/) and pick them up. If you miss the deadline you may need to do this on your own. Make sure to ask for "**engineering paper**", which reduces the price down to  about $17. You can also [upload your PDF poster](https://www.ldiline.com/upload) to speed up the process, but make sure to choose the Lawrenceville location and pick it up before the CREATE symposium on Thu Nov 14 at 2pm.
