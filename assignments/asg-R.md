# Extended to midnight Thu Sep 5th!

This assignment is intended to give you a chance to practice with R. We will spend some class time on it. You should have installed Rstudio on your own computer, but let us know if you can't and we can provide alternatives. Do not post all your results here on Reddit, instead follow **submission instructions** at the bottom.

# Questions

1. Load your CSV dataset into R as instructed in previous assignment. Select columns to plot together to visualize your data. Make at least two graphs showing different information. One graph must show the histogram distribution of a numerical column. Explain what type of distribution you have and its features. Second graph can be from any of the ones we reviewed in class. Make sure axes, lines are annotated and it has a title. Briefly explain what your graphs show. Show the R code that resulted in the graphs.
2. Do a simple statistical calculation (e.g. mean, standard deviation, mode, median, etc.) with R that aligns with your hypothesis and plot/report results. Explain what the result means in terms of your question.
3. We will apply statistical tests to your dataset to gain insight in answering your questions. Start by first applying a correlation or regression analysis to find relationships. Explain how the relationship aligns ith your questions.
4. For the second statistical test, divide your dataset into two groups of rows based on your question and apply a test that we discussed in class (t-test, ANOVA, ...) to test for significant differences. Show the code and briefly explain the results. (Note to self: ask to show distributions of the variables before running the test)

# Submission instructions:

To submit your report you have a few options, listed with most preferred first. If you post your report online, you can start having an online presence demonstrating your data science skills, which will help you find employment later. Do ONE of the following:

1. Create an [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html) document in R Studio and use one of the the [sharing options](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/html-share.html) to create a link to post here. Start by attaching your CSV file or linking to your dataset source so others can replicate your analysis. Then, create a new R Markdown file that will hold your analysis. We will go over this in class (also see [Markdown tutorial](https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/index.html)).
2. Create a public [Gist](https://gist.github.com/) and post the link here. It uses the basic [Markdown language](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) where you can [insert images inline](https://stackoverflow.com/a/53560172) with the text to make your report. Here is an [example Gist](https://gist.github.com/Ragedancer/15ee8e2b7b1a8cafb86b83ff7db1763f) and [another one](https://gist.github.com/sprice2/1aae96f077e81ba16cb654926d86e52b).
3. Reply below like in Assignment 2, and provide external links for images. This will be private to our class, so you get no public reputation.
4. Least desirable option: Make a Word doc and upload it somewhere (OneDrive, Dropbox, Google Drive) so you can share the link here (you may lose points if you select this option).
